# Node.js server side randomization

Hello! Thank you for visiting this repository. Here I'm pushed my first Node.js project that is week 37 homework for the #100Devs bootcamp.

## Overview

The homework is to make a coin flip game where the randomization happens on the server side.

The game is pretty basic but I gained a deeper understanding of servers.

From here I will be practicing more and learning Express and MongoDB.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank Leon for making an [awesome free bootcamp](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/). I want be more involved with this to help others and learn faster.

I was able to make the CSS for the flip animation by studing code in [this fantastic example](https://codingartistweb.com/2021/05/flip-a-coin-html-css-javascript/)
